GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line

** Must have a Triangle, Circle, and Square classes (recommended a Shape class they inherit from)
** Each shape class should be TESTED for a render() method that returns a string for the SVG file with the given shape color
** Walkthrough video must show all test passing from the command line
Example:
    const shape = new Triangle();
    shape.setColor("blue");
    expect(shape.render()).toEqual('<polygon points="150, 18 244, 182 56, 182" fill="blue" />');
