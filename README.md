# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description

The application uses inquirier to get information from the user about their desired logo. It prompts them to input up to 3 characters, a font color, a shape type, and a shape color, and dynamically generates an SVG file with those inputs. The application will not produce a logo that provides more than 3 characters for the text of the logo. The application also comes with tests that verify the classes for each shape return the correct SVG elements for the SVG file. 

## Usage

After running 'npm i' to install dependencies, run 'node index.js' from the command line while in the project directory to begin the application. After responding to all of the inquirer prompts, the application will generate the SVG file successfully.
